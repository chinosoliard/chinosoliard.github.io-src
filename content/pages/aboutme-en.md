I am an IT guy, techie, and Free Software enthusiast.  
I live in Parana, Argentina, and the posibilities about going away are few.  

All my life I liked IT in general. Since 2014, I am Programming Senior technician, and, while attending the carreer, I noticed how much I like GNU/Linux system administration (Yes, I studied something I do not like). In 2012, I start contributing with Fedora Project, and today I'm a FOSS activist.  
Since 2007, I work in Entre Rios' Hydraulic department , doing systems administration, managing networks, managing servers, maintaining automatic weather stations and watching people strolling; All this to get the code "supplement to reach the minimum" in the paycheck.
