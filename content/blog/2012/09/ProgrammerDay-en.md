Summary: Today is day 256 of the year, day unofficially chosen to celebrate the “Programmer day”.  
**Why the day 256?**  
It was chosen because it is the number of different combinations that can be represented with 8 bits, number well known among programmers. It is also the largest power of 2 less than 365, the number of days a year.

>Programming today is a race between software engineers striving to build bigger and better idiot-proof programs, and the Universe trying to produce bigger and better idiots. So far, the Universe is winning. - Rick Cook
