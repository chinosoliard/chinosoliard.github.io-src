Summary:According to a personal statistic, I can say that the dust inside the CPUs and other equipment is relatively proportional to the distance from the floor in which these are. This may be because, even when walking, dust rises, and this dust ends inside. 

Cleaning the inside of the CPU is something that should be done routinely to prevent problems become greater, because when dust accumulates, it is only a matter of moisture to a short circuit, for example.
